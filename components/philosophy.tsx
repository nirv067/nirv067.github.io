              Neeraj focuses on building stable, maintainable systems that support business-critical operations over the
              long term. System ownership means taking full responsibility for production reliability, security, and
              creating a solid foundation that others can build upon.
            </p>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground">
              With 9+ years of hands-on experience, Neeraj has learned that the best solutions come from deeply
              understanding the problem, collaborating across teams, and choosing boring, proven technologies over
              flashy trends.
